# clubForm

# Hey everyone. This is a sign up form that I created for my school's computer science club. It is made with pure HTML/CSS. 

# When submitted, it submits all info to a google sheets spreadsheet. If you want to know how I did this, see below. 

# I used sheetmonkey.io to get a link that I could put in my HTML meta element's action attribute. This makes the post method write the submitted info onto the given spreadsheet.
